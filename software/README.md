# Software Design: The Microcontroller

When building the software, following the method in ESC180 and ESC190, we wrote code constructively by first having code that is able to run and then add components toward desired functionality.

`code_v1.py`: basic code that lights up when the button is pressed

`code_v2.py`: code that has desired functionality

`code.py`: refactored and added comments to make it more readable
