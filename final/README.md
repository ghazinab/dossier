# Integration and Evaluation

We assembled the structural, electrical, and software part of our design. Our design functions as intended.

`demonstration_case_fit.mp4`: demonstrating fitting the assembled breadboard into the 3D printed case

`demonstration_function.mp4`: demonstrating working lights and controller

`without_case.jpg`: breadboard without case, showing assembled circuit


# Evaluation of Objectives

## Structural System

**Hardware protection**: The case shields wires and resistors, but the Pico is exposed due to its elevation from the breadboard. This sacrifice was made for simplicity and aesthetics.

**Polished appearance**: The case shields wires and resistors, but the Pico is exposed due to its elevation from the breadboard. This sacrifice was made for simplicity and aesthetics.

**Integration with hardware**: Case fits the hardware seamlessly, without the need of extra padding.


## Electrical System

**Efficiency**: Maximized the LED output by limiting resistor ohmage to produce a more efficient system

**Illumination**: System designed so LEDs operate at their highest rated output

**White light**: Red, green, and blue lights are combined to simulate white light

**Ease of use**: Use of one mode of interaction with the system to reduce complexity


## Software System

Readability: We used docstrings and comments to make the program readable

Efficiency: The code was written to be as concise as possible, using tuples and loops
