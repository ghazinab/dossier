# Greenhouse Lighting System

Harry Chen, Nabeth Ghazi, Nasrudeen Oladimeji


## Introduction and Objectives

The project designs a greenhouse lighting system as per ESC204 assignment requirement. The design contains three subsystems: structural, electrical, and software. The assignment instruction frames objectives including functionality that provide desired lighting for plants and workers, as well as performance objectives like energy efficiency and usability. As engineering students, we also want the design to be simple while demonstrating our understanding of course knowledge. 


## File Structure

With the exception of `README.md`, files are named all lowercase with words separated by underscores, followed by extension. Filename prefixes are aligned to keep files organized in order with default sorting.

The design dossier contains folders `structural`, `electrical`, and `software` for three design subsystems, which contain files (images, videos, code, design files, etc.) as well as separate `README.md` files for an overview of our design process. The folder `final` contains media for our final results, with `README.md` evaluating the utility of our product.
